**üö® CRITICAL: Read [CODE_RULES.md](CODE_RULES.md) before making any audio-related changes!**

This project extends AudioSocket with real-time transcription capabilities, supporting both Vosk and AssemblyAI providers.

## üéØ Project Overview

AudioSocket Transcriber is a TCP-based server that:
- Listens for AudioSocket connections on port 9019
- Provides real-time audio transcription using Vosk or AssemblyAI
- Supports audio playback (greeting + ambient audio)
- Saves transcripts and raw audio files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT AUDIO RULES

**NEVER FORGET: Audio chunk size must be 320 bytes (8000Hz √ó 20ms √ó 2 bytes)**

- ‚ùå **Wrong**: Custom chunk sizes like 160 bytes
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Use `audiosocket.DefaultSlinChunkSize`
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: Custom timing implementations  
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Use `audiosocket.SendSlinChunks()`

**See [CODE_RULES.md](CODE_RULES.md) for complete rules and troubleshooting!**

# Original AudioSocket Library

AudioSocket is a simple TCP-based protocol for sending and receiving realtime
audio streams.

There exists a protocol definition (below), a Go library, and Asterisk
application and channel interfaces.

**NOTE:** [@florentchauveau](https://github.com/florentchauveau) has contributed [DTMF support](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/1138) to the AudioSocket protocol. The patch has been merged into `master` and will be included in Asterisk versions 20.X, 21.X, and 22.X.

## Protocol definition

The singular design goal of AudioSocket is to present the simplest possible
audio streaming protocol, initially based on the constraints of Asterisk audio.
Each packet contains a three-byte header and a variable payload.  The header is
composed of a one-byte type and a two-byte length indicator.

The minimum message length is three bytes:  type and payload-length.  Hangup
indication, for instance, is `0x00 0x00 0x00`.

### Types

  - `0x00` - Terminate the connection (socket closure is also sufficient)
  - `0x01` - Payload will contain the UUID (16-byte binary representation) for the audio stream
  - `0x03` - Payload is 1 byte (ascii) DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) digit
  - `0x10` - Payload is signed linear, 16-bit, 8kHz, mono PCM (little-endian)
  - `0xff` - An error has occurred; payload is the (optional)
    application-specific error code.  Asterisk-generated error codes are listed
    below.

### Payload length

The payload length is a 16-bit unsigned integer (big endian) indicating how many bytes are
in the payload.

### Payload

The content of the payload is defined by the header: type and length.

### Asterisk error codes

Error codes are application-specific.  The error codes for Asterisk are
single-byte, bit-packed error codes:

  - `0x01` - hangup of calling party
  - `0x02` - frame forwarding error
  - `0x04` - memory (allocation) error

## Asterisk usage

There are two Asterisk implementations: a channel interface and a dialplan
application interface.  Each of these lends itself to simplify a different
use-case, but they work in exactly the same way.

The following examples demonstrate an AudioSocket connection to a server at
`server.example.com` running on TCP port 9092.  The UUID (which is chosen
arbitrarily) of the call is `40325ec2-5efd-4bd3-805f-53576e581d13`.

Dialplan application:

```
exten = 100,1,Verbose("Call to AudioSocket via Dialplan Application")
 same = n,Answer()
 same = n,AudioSocket(40325ec2-5efd-4bd3-805f-53576e581d13,server.example.com:9092)
 same = n,Hangup()
```

Channel interface:

```
exten = 101,1,Verbose("Call to AudioSocket via Channel interface")
 same = n,Answer()
 same = n,Dial(AudioSocket/server.example.com:9092/40325ec2-5efd-4bd3-805f-53576e581d13/c(slin))
 same = n,Hangup()
```
